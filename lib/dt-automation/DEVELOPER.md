# Working on DT Automation

This document describes the development and package validation workflow for
`@into-cps-association/dt-automation`.

See [`README.md`](./README.md) for installation and package usage.

React components and other React-specific code do not belong in this package.

## Prerequisites

DT Automation is developed on Node.js 26 and supports Node.js 24 and
later; CI checks both. It uses Yarn 1.22.22.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the commands below from the `dt-automation` directory.

## Common Commands

```bash
yarn syntax           # Run ESLint and apply fixes.
yarn format           # Format the source files.
yarn typecheck        # Check the TypeScript types.
yarn test:unit        # Run the unit tests.
yarn build            # Build the package.
yarn smoke:package    # Test the package from a clean consumer.
yarn validate:package # Run type checking and the package test.
yarn prep             # Run the full preparation workflow.
yarn clean            # Remove generated files.
```

`yarn syntax` and `yarn format` can modify source files.

## Build

Build the package with:

```bash
yarn build
```

The build creates the JavaScript and TypeScript declarations distributed in the
package.

`tsup` builds the ESM JavaScript entry point. TypeScript generates declaration
files and `tsc-alias` rewrites internal aliases for package consumers.

The generated files are written to `dist`.

## Test

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

The tests run in Jest's Node environment, without a DOM.

Run the TypeScript checks with:

```bash
yarn typecheck
```

For a normal development check, use:

```bash
yarn typecheck
yarn test:unit
yarn build
```

### Runtime Checks

The package runs in browsers and in Node.js, so three checks keep the APIs
that only one of them provides out of `index.ts` and `src/`:

- ESLint rejects browser-only globals such as `window`, `document` and
  `sessionStorage`, Node.js-only globals such as `process` and `Buffer`, and
  imports of Node.js built-in modules.
- `yarn typecheck` compiles without the DOM and Node.js types.
  `src/shared-runtime.d.ts` declares the few globals that both provide.
- `yarn build` uses the `neutral` platform of tsup, so a `node:` import fails
  the build.

Code that needs the API of one runtime belongs in the importing application,
which registers it through a setter such as `setMeasurementResultsStorage`.

## Validate the Package

Use the package smoke test for changes to exports, build configuration, or
package structure:

```bash
yarn smoke:package
```

The test builds the package, creates an archive with `yarn pack`, installs it in
a temporary project, and runs `scripts/smoke-consumer.mjs` there. That script
imports the package through its published name and uses it the way a Node.js
service does: it registers in-memory services, builds a results export, purges
the measurement data and calls `handleBeforeUnload`.

CI runs the test on Node.js 24 and 26. It also checks that the archive holds
only `package.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, `dist/index.js` and the
declaration files.

Run the type check and package test together with:

```bash
yarn validate:package
```

This verifies the package as an external consumer receives it rather than by
importing implementation files directly.

## Public Exports

`index.ts` defines the public package API.

Add new consumer-facing exports there and import them using the package root:

```ts
import { formatName } from '@into-cps-association/dt-automation';
```

Do not rely on imports from `src`. Internal paths are not part of the published
export map.

## Test a Local Package

To inspect package behavior manually without publishing it, build and create a
local archive:

```bash
yarn build
yarn pack --filename ../dt-automation-local.tgz
```

Install the archive in a temporary project:

```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add ../dt-automation-local.tgz
```

Test imports using the package name
`@into-cps-association/dt-automation`.

For regular development, prefer `yarn smoke:package`, which performs the same
package-level check automatically.
